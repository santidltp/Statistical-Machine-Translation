san francisco – it has never been easy to have a rational conversation about the value of gold . 
lately ,  with gold prices up more than 300 %  over the last decade ,  it is harder than ever . 
just last december ,  fellow economists martin feldstein and nouriel roubini each penned op - eds bravely questioning bullish market sentiment ,  sensibly pointing out gold ’ s risks . 
wouldn ’ t you know it ? 
since their articles appeared ,  the price of gold has moved up still further .  gold prices even hit a record - high  $ 1 , 300 recently . 
last december ,  many gold bugs were arguing that the price was inevitably headed for  $ 2 , 000 . 
now ,  emboldened by continuing appreciation ,  some are suggesting that gold could be headed even higher than that . 
one successful gold investor recently explained to me that stock prices languished for a more than a decade before the dow jones index crossed the 1 , 000 mark in the early 1980 ’ s .
